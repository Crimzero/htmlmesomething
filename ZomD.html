                You prepare to carefully lower yourself down when the ledge gives out beneath ypu.
                End over end you tumble, hitting your head on a rock sends fireworks dancing across your vision, and you land poorly on your ankle.  Was that a snap?<br>
                Surely you are dead.<br>
                What? No? These braindead nincompoops haven't noticed you.  What a bunch of slack-jawed idiots, happy day!  There is still hope!<br>
                While you are quietly celebrating your close call with the reaper the biggest, slimiest rat you have ever seen runs up your trousers and is headed straight for your family jewels.<br>
                &quot;EEEEEEK!&quot;, you squeal as you beat and shake the rat out of your pants.
                Filled with a dawning realization you look up into a hundred hungry eyes moments before you are devoured.<br>
