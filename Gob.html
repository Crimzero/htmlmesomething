            <p id="description">The sounds of the horde fade into the background as you retrace your steps.<br>
            Running your hand along the wall of the cave you are suddenly met with open air.<br>
            A small opening only tall enough for a child to walkl through, you though it was just a shadow the first time you passed it.<br>
            Crawling through the tiny tunnel eventually brings you a small antechamber, past the cave mouth purple and blue shades of dying twilight paint the landscape.<br>
            The only obstical between you and freedom is a lone sleeping goblin softly snoring in the corner.
            The goblin's equipment, including it's dagger is piled beside it's makeshift bed.
