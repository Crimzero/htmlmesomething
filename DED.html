            <p id="description">It turns out that elves have keen hearing.<br>
                After taking 2, maybe 3, steps toward the elf she turns on you and throws some weird ball string things.<br>
                You are wrapped up tighter than a summer ham (That's really tight where you are from.)<br>
                Unable to free yourshep you flop around on the ground like a fish out of water.<br>
                The elf casually walks over to your prone form, &quot;I thought a rival was trying to put a knife in my back, but it was just a huge payday wandering right into my hands.&quot;<br>
                Now that she is closer you can see that her skin, while porcelain smooth, is the color of ash and her eyes glow red with a cruel shine.<br>
                You try all the diplomatic trick in your limited arsenal to no avail as the elf shoves you into a sack with about a dozen gnomes all bound and gagged.<br>
                &quot;Alrighty gents and gent-ettes it's off to the slave pits for you and off to the tavern for me!&quot; She hoists the sack over her shuolder and begins whistling that jaunty tune.<br>
