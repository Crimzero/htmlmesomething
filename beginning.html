            <h1>Into the Mouth of Mud-ness</h1>
            <p id="description">Diligently you dig the dirt.  Turning the soil so that the deeper earth can be exposed to the loving glow of the sun.  <br>
                Why do you do this, because that's how Pappy Shepp and GrandDaddy Shap did it before you and if it worked for them then it'll work for you.<br>
                While digging a particularly onery plot, there is a slight rumble followed by a great falling sensation as the world goes darkish.<br>
            </p>
            <h2>Rumble! Crash! Thud!</h2>

            <p id="description">You find yourshep far below the surface.<br>
                The safty of your ancestral farm is just a spec of light far out of reach. <br>
                Your body aches but your mind is clear. <br>
                You need to find a way out of here and fast.<br>
                Mumma Sheppina always said that, &quotunholy things lurked in the darkness so they could hide their foul acts from the light, lest they be burned away.&quot <br>>
                Looking around you see two tunnels.<br> <br> <br> 
                <h3>Do you:</h3>
                <a href="lost.html" id="choice">Run shreiking into the darkness. Hopefully your cries for help will be answered!</a><br><br>
                <a href="DE.html" id="choice">Calm yourshep and listen.  You think you heard something from the right tunnel</a><br><br>
                <a href="lost.html" id="choice">Wait for your eyes to adjust to the darkness.  You think you see some light coming from the left tunnel.</a>
