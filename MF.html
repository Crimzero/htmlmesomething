            <p id="description">You've decided not to trust strangers that you find fiddling strange sacks far below the surface.<br>
                The side tunnel that you've chosen is brightly lit (relativly speaking) by some glowing mushrooms.<br>
                The rough natural stone and bioluminesent fungus slowly give way to a smooth purplish rock that is oddly spongey when you step on it.<br>
                The tunnel is still well lit despite there being no obvious source of light.<br>
                Travelling further still it's hard to tell but you think you are heading up.<br><br>
                You come to a fork in the cave.<br>
                To the right, another bog-standard tunnel but there is perhaps the faintest hint of a breeze.<br>
                Center is an ornate archway carved to look like... slimey tentacles?<br>
                and to the left is... !?! A Dwarf?<br>
                So busy were you with your inner-monolog that you completely overlooked the short and stout little man struggling to free himself from a trap.<br><br>
                &quot;Aye'o buddy, mind giving me a hand here?&quot;<br><br>
                Before you can respond a chilling presence makes your hair stand on end, and something primal in your brain is screaming, &quot;RUN!&quot;<br>
                Sliding down the center corridor is a thing in the shape of a man but it's head is a squid. (Trust me it's real scary!)<br>
                You have only seconds to act!<br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            Do you:<br><br>
            <a href="Zom.html" id="choice">Run left!  The dwarf has already triggered the trap there and squidface will probably stop to deal with him first anyway.</a><br><br>
            <a href="MFD.html" id="choice">Help the dwarf!  Upon closer inspection he looks pretty tough, together the two of you can beat this thing!</a><br><br>
            <a href="lost.html" id="choice">Run right! The path of least resistance, no squid, no dwarf.</a><br><br>
