                Oh sure your still work the dirt sunup to sundown.<br>
                but you charge a modest fee to adventurers to explore the &quot;DIRT HOLE&reg;&quot;<br>
                and you don't dig the dirt quite as vigorously as you once did<br>
                and sleeping isn't easy with all the things you had to do to get here...<br>
                but you are Shep, and you are alive, Congratulation!
