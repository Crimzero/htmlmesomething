            <p id="description">You grab the dwarf under the arms and pull as hard as you can!<br>
                The dwarf's feet are stuck in some kind of jelly but your Shep strength is mighty, MIGHTY!<br>
                SLUUUUURP!
                The dwarves feet are pulled from the jelly and you both flop onto the ground.
                &quot;Let's go boy-o it's almost upon us!&quot;
                The squidman is standing just a few yards away.  It's jet black eyes inspecting us like insects that got caught in it's web.<br>
                You turn to run.  The beast raises one hooked, boney finger in your direction and you fall limp to the ground like a discarded toy.<br>
                Your mind is racing but your body won't respond.  You catch the dwarf's eyes, pleading silently for help.
                The dwarf hesitates fo a moment.<br>
                &quot;Agh damn it all!&quot; as he pulls out his short sword and charges the monster.<br>
                The fight is brief.  The dwarf never landed a hit.<br>
                THe dwarf's limp body hangs from squidface's mouth(?) twitching occasionally, a horrid sucking sound fills the cavern.<br>

            <p id="illithid">Come to me.</p>
            <p>Like a puppet on a string you rise and shuffle your way over the hungry monstrosity, powerless to stop yourself.
