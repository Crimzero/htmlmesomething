            <p id="description">Moving quickly and quietly you grab the goblins dagger and thrust it into the sleeping sentry's chest.<br>
            The goblin awaks screaming and thrashing it claws at your face and arms.<br>
            You push the dagger in deeper!<br>
            The goblin curses you in it's shrill, gibbering language then spits a blood filled loogey onto your face.
            You raise the dagger again and plunge it into the goblin<br>
            It reaches for something, anything to defend it self with.<br>
            Again you raise the dagger,<br>
            and again,<br>
            and again,<br>
            and again,<br>
            and again...<br>
            </p>
           <p>The goblin is ded!<br>
        True, that was a lot louder than you thought it would be, and a hell of a lot more violent, but you are alive and it is ded.</p>
            <p> Well go on then: <br><br>
